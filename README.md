## Hi there

I build practical prediction systems at the intersection of finance, sports analytics, and algorithmic problem solving.

## What I Work On

- Predictive AI systems for finance and portfolio research
- NBA and football match prediction workflows (data, modeling, backtesting)
- Project Euler and advanced math/problem-solving exercises
- Algorithm development and performance-focused implementations in Python, Java, and C++
- End-to-end data pipelines and CLI tooling for experimentation

## Currently

- Improving model calibration and evaluation for prediction tasks
- Expanding my Project Euler and Erdos-style problem notes
- Sharing more reproducible ML/analytics workflows on GitHub

## Contact

- Email: alper@mercurycodelab.com
- Open to collaboration on predictive AI and applied math projects

## Hobbies

- Cars
- Movies
